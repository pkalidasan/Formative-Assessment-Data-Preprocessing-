# Formative-Assessment-Data-Preprocessing-
Formative Assessment ( Data Preprocessing )

The main objective of this project is to design and implement a robust data preprocessing system to address common challenges such as missing values, outliers, inconsistent formatting, and noise. Effective data preprocessing aims to enhance the quality, reliability, and usefulness of the data for machine learning.

Key Components to be Fulfilled

Data Exploration 

Explore the data, list unique values in each feature, and determine their lengths.
Perform statistical analysis and rename the columns for clarity.

Data Cleaning 

Identify and treat missing and inappropriate values.
Remove all duplicate rows.
Detect and handle outliers.
Replace the value 0 in the 'age' column with NaN.
Handle null values using appropriate measures (removal, or replacement with mean/median/mode).

Data Analysis 

Filter the data to include only rows where age > 40 and salary < 5000.
Plot a chart comparing age and salary.
Count the number of people from each place and represent it visually.

Data Encoding 

Convert categorical variables into numerical representations using techniques like one-hot encoding and label encoding.

Feature Scaling 

Perform feature scaling using StandardScaler and MinMaxScaler after encoding the categorical variables.

Steps to Implement the Project

Data Exploration

Load the dataset.
List unique values and their lengths for each feature.
Perform statistical analysis.
Rename columns as needed for clarity.

Data Cleaning

Identify missing and inappropriate values and decide on treatment methods.
Remove duplicate rows.
Identify and handle outliers.
Replace 0 values in the 'age' column with NaN.
Treat null values using appropriate measures.

Data Analysis

Filter the dataset based on specified conditions (age > 40, salary < 5000).
Plot a chart with age and salary.
Count and visualize the number of people from each place.

Data Encoding

Apply one-hot encoding and label encoding to categorical variables.

Feature Scaling

Scale the features using StandardScaler and MinMaxScaler.
